# Getting Started with Create React App

## Overview

Lab 01:  First attempt as using React, components, and props.

Lab 02:  A little more experience working with the components and props, also adding in state and bootstrap feature of a card.

Lab 03:  Created a new component to create new modal feature with the help of bootstrap, passing information through use of state.

Lab 04:  A fresh look at yesterday's modal feature and a collaboration with Tammy Do and Ben Mills and Justin Hammerly (all TA's), modal works.  Form created and with a selection, photos can be sorted by number of horns.
